# Steps to create ARP Spoofer:

# Get the IP address that we want to spoof
# Get the MAC address of the IP that we want to spoof
# Then create a spoofing packet using the ARP() function to set the target IP, Spoof IP and itâ€™s MAC address that we found above.
# Start the spoofing
# Display the information of the numbers of packets sent
# Finally, re-set the ARP tables of the spoofed address to defaults after spoofing
